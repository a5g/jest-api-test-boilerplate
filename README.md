# api-test-jest-boilerplate

A boilerplate project that uses jest, node-fetch, typescript for api testing in Node.js.
This project is useful not only as an example of api testing in Node.js, but it also includes examples of the Service Object pattern, JSON Schema Validation (using [jest-json-schema](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-json-schema)) and some practical examples for using Request to build an automated test suite with jest.

This covers testing of all possible methods of request like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. There are multiple user friendly reporters integrated to easily analyse the results.

Not just that, it also provides the debugging support in VSCode.
